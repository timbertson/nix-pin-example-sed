@c Ugly hack to enable using new texinfo commands '@codequotebacktick'
@c and '@codequoteundirected' or define empty fallbacks if they are
@c not available.

@ifclear txicommandconditionals
@c If we got here, this is a REALLY old texinfo (pre 5.0),
@c and '@ifcommandnotdefined' is not defined.
@c Assume these commands are not defined as well.

@end macro
@macro codequoteundirected

@ifset txicommandconditionals
@c if we got here, this texinfo supports checking for defined
@c commands. If these commands aren't available - define empty
@c fallbacks.
@ifcommandnotdefined codequotebacktick
@macro codequotebacktick
@end macro
@macro codequoteundirected
